This post blog is not dynamic. It gets the data form the MarkdownFile, 
but it doesn't import the file dynamically from parameters. 


[Vite supports glob-type dynamic imports like import('./locales/*.json')but does not support dynamic string imports like import(`./locales/${locales}.json`)](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/772#issuecomment-858993304)
