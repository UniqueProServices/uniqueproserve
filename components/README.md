# COMPONENTS
Important: keep the name of the nested components the same you name the partent folders:
example: /components/blog/MyComponent = BlogMyComponent.vue

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._
